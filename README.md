CMake (autoconfig)(replace ) -> make(Makefile generated bt cmake) -> ctest -> make install | cpack

###### `GNU Make` is a the GNU variant of Make (be sure to use at least GNU make version 4).. It is quite powerful (much more than the POSIX specification of make). You definitely can code a GNU Makefile which is self sufficient and as powerful as CMake (without the inconvenience of CMake), thanks to the many extra features of GNU Make (e.g. scripting in Guile).

#### advantage:
using the same cmake input file, cmake can generate project files for all sorts of different build control tools
